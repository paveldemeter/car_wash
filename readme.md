### Defining Purpose and Problem

>  Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App?

Have you ever sat in your friends car and were too shy to let them know their vehicle smells like Shrek's feet? Have you had a proper glance at your car and said to yourself "Wow, my car looks like a swamp... Ill clean it this weekend"

I am sorry to tell you this but this weekend will never arrive.

Driving around various place, I see vehicles that are constantly not being taken care of and thus leading to depreciating your vehicles value, at the end of the day Exterior & Interior is everything.

Splash Mobile Auto Wash is designed to fix this problem, It is specifically designed to make your vehicle look like it just came from a dealerships showroom & also to make sure you don't keep neglecting the vehicles value, We can sort out a package deal for you to take care of the Vehicles health! 

> Why is it a _problem_ that needs solving?

The reason why this is a problem that needs solving is I have done research on how much a private detailer makes and it can be anywhere from $50AUD-$200AUD for detailing a vehicle, Some Vehicle Owners don't get what they pay for & some Detailers/Washers don't earn as much as they should. 

Splash Mobile Auto Wash connects people.

From online social research I see a lot of people asking about professional detailers or just simply want a quick cheap clean and need it ASAP. We ensure security and we ensure the service is provided from both sides.
